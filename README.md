## Description

This application is designed to host DJ mixes/setlists so that DJs can share them with their peers and to also keep track 
of their own. The users have the ability to make new setlists, edit them and also can view other user's setlists as well.

## General Usage

1. On their first visit, users will be greeted by a Login page. Users will have the ability to create a new account.

2. Once logged in, the user will be greeted by a homepage with a navigation bar on the top.

3. The homepage displays a list of all the latest mixes created by users. The user can use the search bar to search by setlist name, DJ name or by genre name.

4. Clicking on any of the setlists will bring the user to the setlist page. The setlist page offers a short description card
as well as the tracklist of songs used to make the set. 

5. Clicking on 'View DJ Profile' in the description card will allow you to view the DJ's profile.

6. The Profile page will display their biography as well as their user avatar. 

7. The user may delete their entire account by scrolling to the bottom. This will also delete all asociated setlists made by the user.

## Creating Your Own Set

1. Users can create their own set by clicking on "CREATE NEW SET" on the navigation bar.

3. For the tracks, the user must fill out the name, artist, length, BPM (beats per minute) and genre using the rightmost card. Once
complete, the user can click on "ADD TRACK" to add the track to the setlist. Repeat this step for every track in the setlist.

4. Track information can be edited once it has been added using the '✏️' icon. Once track information has been edited, you can 
save the changes with the '💾' icon. Note that you will not be allowed to edit anything else until the '💾' icon has been pressed again.
